# Up and Coming Video Games

## Project Overview 
The topic for this project is "Up and Coming Video Games." The following task for this topic is to determine the key aspects and features of video games in order to predict what next type of video game will be successful and popular to players. This information can be used by potential clients to guide their decisions on the type of video game created to produce the most potential profits.

The topic was selected due to the growing video game industry and the wide availability of content from various social media, company, and gaming platforms.

Using Steam library data, we wanted to determine what makes a video game successful or “popular” to players, and to predict what next type of video game to meet that standard.

### Question(s): 
* What features determine a video game’s popularity or success? 
* Is there a relation between a game’s rating and genre? 
* Is there a relation between a game’s rating  and tagged categories?
