# Config.py Instructions 

For the PostgreSQL Connection String within the SQL_Connection notebook or Machine Learning notebooks, please create a "config.py" file within the same folder level that contains the following code: 

    db_password = 'PASSWORD'

    port_number = '####'

    db_name = 'DATABASE NAME'

Replace the text within the strings with the appropriate values to connect to your local PostgreSQL database.
